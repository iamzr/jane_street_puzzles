# Jane Street's Monthly Puzzles

Welcome to my repository for solving the [Jane Street Monthly Puzzles](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/)!

Each month, Jane Street posts a new challenge that encourages creative thinking and problem-solving across math, programming, logic, and more. This repository contains my solutions, explanations, and scripts for each puzzle.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a specific month's puzzle and contains:
- **Problem Statement**: The original puzzle description.
- **Solution Explanation**: A detailed explanation of the approach and reasoning behind the solution.
- **Code**: Any scripts or code used to solve the puzzle, typically in Python, but other languages might be used as well.
